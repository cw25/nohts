# Nohts


## Introduction

Nohts is a simple Javascript-based tool for overlaying annotations on text (plain text, code, etc.) or math expressions (LaTeX). Nohts can then be exported as PNG images.

I built this so I could make better slide decks, better documentation, better Slack messages, and just generally clearer explanations in my life as a developer and data scientist. I hope it helps you too!

To try it yourself, visit the [Nohts website](http://iamchriswalker.com/nohts).

Nohts is a work in progress. I welcome all feedback! You can find me on Twitter at [@iamchriswalker](https://twitter.com/iamchriswalker) or email me at [cw25@mac.com](mailto:cw25@mac.com).

(I also welcome issue reports and pull requests!)


## How does it work?

Just a few simple steps:

* Enter text or a LaTeX expression
* Draw highlight boxes around the parts you want to explain
* Fill in annotations
* Position the annotations
* Export your Noht to a PNG file
* Profit!
